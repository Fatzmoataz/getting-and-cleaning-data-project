## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the files for the project of the coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data. The repository contains the following files:

- README.md 
- CodeBook.md : describes the variables, the data, and the transformations performed to clean up the original data.
- run_analysis.R : An R script which takes the original data  and clean it as described in the CodeBook to obtain "tidy_data.txt". The script will create a directory called data in the file working directory, download the original data to it and then clean it and produce the file "tidy_data.txt". 
- tidy_data.txt : a tidy data set obtained by running the script as described in the CodeBook.md.
